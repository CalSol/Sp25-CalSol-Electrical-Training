# Section 1: Introduction

Welcome to the CalSol Electrical subteam! To ensure everybody starts off on the same page, we ask that you complete this training.

For this training, you are going to be designing a PCB that can create PWM waves (don't worry if you don't know what this is!). This lab is going to have a major emphasis on PCB layout, so although the schematic (circuit drawing) will be given to you, you will be designing your own layout. 

### Here is a lab walkthrough video:

### Here is a general overview of the training:
- [Section 2](./Section2.md) is an overview of basic electrical concepts you will learn in classes EECS 16A/B. If you have already taken those classes, feel free to take a look over the document as a refresher.
- [Section 3](./Section3.md) introduces KiCad, which is the software we will be using to design schematics and PCBs. This section focuses on the schematics portion of KiCad.
- [Section 4](./Section4.md) goes over key concepts in a motor controller such as PWM, MOSFETs, and 555 timers.
- [Section 5](./Section5.md) goes over the PCB layout portion of KiCad.
- [Section 6](./Section6.md) is the bring-up portion of the training.

## Deadline for returning AND new members (Sunday Feb 9th)

# OFFICE HOUR TIMES
In-person Office hours for help and checkoffs. 
## All Office hours will be held in Cory 246 (SuperNode)

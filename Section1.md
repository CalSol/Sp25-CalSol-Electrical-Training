# Introduction

Welcome to the CalSol Electrical subteam! To ensure everybody starts off on the same page, we ask that you complete this training.

For this training, you are going to be designing PCB for a motor controller. This is a very integral part of CalSol, as we need to be able to control the speed of the electric motors in the car at all times.

Here is a general overview of the training:
- [Section 2](./Section2.md) is an overview of basic electrical concepts you will learn in classes EECS 16A/B. If you have already taken those classes, feel free to take a look over the document as a refresher.
- [Section 3](./Section3.md) introduces KiCad, which is the software we will be using to design schematics and PCBs. This section focuses on the schematics portion of KiCad.
- [Section 4](./Section4.md) goes over key concepts in a motor controller such as PWM, MOSFETs, and 555 timers.
- [Section 5](./Section5.md) goes over the PCB layout portion of KiCad.
- [Section 6](./Section6.md) is the bring-up portion of the training.

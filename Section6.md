Congratulations!! You finished the design of your PCB! We do not expect you to buy your own board, instead, we have naked PCBs already designed and ordered by our lovely CalSol team. 

You are more than welcome to fabricate your own layout design! If you decide to use JCLPCB please follow the following links on making Gerber files and drill files (files that tell the manufacturer the design and layout of your board).

Now, go upload your design onto JCLPCB’s website to see if you have passed all their manufacturer constraints. 

Your next step is to show up to any office hour timeslot (see image below) and bring up a pre-designed board. 

What does bring-up mean?
Bring up means to assemble, test, program, and debug to make sure the design is satisfactory and meets all requirements.

In this lab, you will be assembling a PCB of the same circuit. So you will learn how to solder, use the power supply, and use an oscilloscope to verify your PWM signal. 

Show up to office hours to complete the bring-up process. 
THIS IS REQUIRED to pass the lab.
You will need to pass the layout check off beforehand.

Good luck!

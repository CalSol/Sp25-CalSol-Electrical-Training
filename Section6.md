# Section 6: Bring Up
Congratulations!! You finished the design of your PCB!We do not expect you to buy your own board, instead, we have naked PCBs already designed and ordered by our lovely CalSol team. 

What does bring-up mean?
Bring up means to assemble, test, program, and debug to make sure the design is satisfactory and meets all requirements.

Now please follow the following [link](https://jlcpcb.com/help/article/how-to-generate-gerber-and-drill-files-in-kicad-8) on making Gerber files and drill files (files that tell the manufacturer the design and layout of your board). We are using JCLPCB.

Now, go upload your design onto [JCLPCB’s website](https://cart.jlcpcb.com/quote?edaOrderUrl=https%3A%2F%2Feasyeda.com%2Forder&electropolishingOnlyNo=no&achieveDate=72) to see if you have passed all their manufacturer constraints. 

## Your next step is to show up to any office hour timeslot (see image below) and bring up a pre-designed board. 

In this last section, you will be assembling a PCB of the same circuit. So you will learn how to solder, use the power supply, and use an oscilloscope to verify your PWM signal. 

### Show up to office hours to complete the bring-up process. THIS IS REQUIRED to pass the lab.
### You will need to pass the layout check off beforehand.

### Good luck!

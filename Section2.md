### What is a PCB?

A PCB (Printed Circuit Board) is a compact circuit made out of various electrical components and wire traces. In this section of the lab we will explain the different parts that make up a PCB, but firstly we must learn the basics of electricity.

### Introduction to Electricity

Let’s learn how we can mathematically analyze circuits with Ohm’s law. Ohm's law relates current, voltage, and resistance in a circuit. Let’s tackle each part of this triangle separately.

Current is the flow of electricity! More specifically, it is the flow of electrons. We denote the flow of the conventional current opposite the flow of electrons with an arrow on a circuit diagram. The unit of current is amps (A).

But what causes electrons to flow? Power sources contain energy, called voltage, creating a difference in potential energy that causes electrons to flow. Picture water flowing downhill, with the hill's height representing voltage. At the top, the water has high potential energy, similar to a high voltage. As the water moves down, it flows naturally to lower points, just like current flows from high voltage to low voltage in a circuit. The steeper the hill (or the greater the voltage difference), the stronger the flow of water, much like a greater voltage difference creates a stronger current. The unit of voltage is voltage (V).

However, the flow of electrons, or current, can be restricted. This is called resistance. The unit of resistance is ohms (Ω).

Together, using the triangle of Ohm’s law, we can analyze a simple circuit!

### Example

What is the current of this circuit? Note, that the resistor (denoted with the zig-zag line) is what creates resistance in a circuit.
